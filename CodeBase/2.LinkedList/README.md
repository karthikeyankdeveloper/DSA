# Learning Path for Linked Lists

  

## 1. Singly Linked Lists

### Basic Concepts:

- Understanding nodes and pointers.

- Basic operations: insertion, deletion, traversal.

  

### Key Operations:

-  **Insertion:** At the beginning, end, and at a specific position.

-  **Deletion:** From the beginning, end, and a specific position.

-  **Traversal:** Print all elements.

-  **Search:** Find a specific element.

-  **Reverse:** Reverse the linked list.

-  **Find Middle:** Find the middle element (use slow and fast pointers).

-  **Detect Loop:** Check for a loop using Floyd’s Cycle Detection algorithm (Tortoise and Hare).

-  **Remove Loop:** If a loop is detected, remove it.

  

## 2. Doubly Linked Lists

### Basic Concepts:

- Understanding nodes with two pointers (next and prev).

- Basic operations with doubly linked lists.

  

### Key Operations:

-  **Insertion:** At the beginning, end, and at a specific position.

-  **Deletion:** From the beginning, end, and a specific position.

-  **Traversal:** Forward and backward traversal.

-  **Search:** Find a specific element.

-  **Reverse:** Reverse the doubly linked list.

-  **Find Middle:** Find the middle element (can be done with two pointers).

  

## 3. Circular Linked Lists

### Basic Concepts:

- Understanding circular references in linked lists.

  

### Key Operations:

-  **Insertion:** At the beginning, end, and at a specific position.

-  **Deletion:** From the beginning, end, and a specific position.

-  **Traversal:** Traverse the circular list and ensure you return to the start.

-  **Search:** Find a specific element.

-  **Detect Loop:** Detecting a loop in a circular linked list (usually simpler as it always has a loop).

-  **Find Starting Point:** If the list has multiple cycles or is a part of a larger list, finding the start of the cycle.

  

# Practice Problems

  

## 1. Singly Linked List Problems:

-  **Detect Cycle:** Use Floyd’s Cycle Detection algorithm.

-  **Merge Two Sorted Lists:** Merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted list.

-  **Intersection of Two Linked Lists:** Find the intersection node of two linked lists.

-  **Remove Duplicates:** Remove duplicate values from a sorted linked list.

  

## 2. Doubly Linked List Problems:

-  **Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List:** Convert a multilevel doubly linked list to a single-level list.

-  **Sort Doubly Linked List:** Sort a doubly linked list.

-  **Rotate Doubly Linked List:** Rotate the doubly linked list by a given number of nodes.

-  **Josephus Problem:** Solve the Josephus problem using a circular linked list.

-  **Split Circular Linked List:** Split a circular linked list into two equal halves.

-  **Detect Loop and Find Length:** Find the length of the loop in a circular linked list.
